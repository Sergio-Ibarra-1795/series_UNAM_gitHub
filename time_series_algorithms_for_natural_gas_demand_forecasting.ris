AB  - Conventional time-series prediction methods for natural gas consumption mainly focus on capturing the temporal feature, neglecting static and dynamic information extraction. The accurate prediction of natural gas consumption possesses of paramount significance in the normal operation of the national economy. This paper proposes a novel method that resolves the deficiency of conventional time series prediction to address this demand via designing a hybrid deep learning framework to extract comprehensive information from gas consumption. The proposed model captures static and dynamic information via encoding gas consumption as matrices and extracts long-term dependency patterns from time series consumption. Subsequently, a customised network is proposed for information fusion. Cases from several different regions in China are studied as examples, and the proposed model is compared with other advanced approaches (such as long short-term memory (LSTM), convolution neural network long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM)). The mean absolute percentage error is reduced by a range of 0.235%–10.303% compared with other models. According to the comparison results, the proposed model provides an efficient time series prediction functionality. It is also proved that, after effectively extracting comprehensive information and integrating long-term information with static and dynamic information, the accuracy and efficiency of natural gas consumption prediction are greatly promoted. A sensitivity analysis of different modules combination is conducted to emphasise the significance of each module in the hybrid framework. The results indicate that the method coupling all these modules leads to significant improvement in prediction accuracy and robustness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Under the idea of low carbon economy, natural gas has drawn widely attention all over the world and becomes one of the fastest growing energies because of its clean, high calorific value, and environmental protection properties. However, policy and political factors, supply-demand relationship and hurricanes can cause the jump in natural gas prices volatility. To address this issue, a deep learning model based on oil and gas news is proposed to predict natural gas price trends in this paper. In this model, news text embedding is conducted by BERT-Base, Uncased on natural gas-related news. Attention model is adopted to balance the weight of the news vector. Meanwhile, corresponding natural gas price embedding is conducted by a BiLSTM module. The Attention-weighted news vectors and price embedding are the inputs of the fused network with transformer is built. BiLSTM is used to extract used price information related with news features. Transformer is employed to capture time series trend of mixed features. Finally, the network achieves an accuracy as 79%, and the performance is better than most traditional machine learning algorithms. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Natural gas is a vital component of energy supply in the world. The price of natural gas as energy commodities has a huge impact on economic growth. Analysis of natural gas price movements and their volatility is very important for world economic actors. Therefore, the price movement of natural gas cannot be observed directly (hidden), so this study focuses on predicting the probability for an increase at natural gas prices within a certain time series data using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). There are three fundamental steps in order to solve the HMM model, the first is calculating the probability of observation using the Forward-Backward algorithm, the second is determining the hidden state sequence using the Viterbi algorithm, and the third is predicting HMM parameters using the Baum-Welch algorithm. This study uses monthly natural gas prices data for the period of February 2011 until 2021. The results showed that the most optimal observation sequence prediction for natural gas prices is around March 2020, then natural gas prices are predicted to fluctuate around April and May 2021. In general, based on HMM analysis in the long term, there will be an upward trend in the prices of natural gas in the future. This is presumably due to limited resources and increasing demand. These results can be considered in the analysis of sustainability energy for natural gas demand in the future in the aspect of time series price movement. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Production performance analysis of shale gas based on dynamic parameters is now playing a more important role as a scientific basis for gas well development plan, and describes the structural features, evolution and predict the future production trends. Owing to multi-gradient of gas demand and high fluctuation of the yield adjustment period, it is difficult to identify whether the change of production parameters of gas well, especially the pressure is caused by natural resource consumption or manual production adjustment. Therefore, time-series prediction for adjustable yield wells is an extraordinarily important and challenging task. In this paper, a prediction framework with a multiple model is proposed. Specifically, the weighted warped K-means clustering (WWKM) algorithm is first presented to partition the dataset into a series of clusters considering the significantly different influence of each variable. Thereafter, a multiple prediction model based on sequence information (MMP-SI) is designed to improve the prediction precision by integrating the overall decreasing trends and local fluctuation features of the dataset. Subsequently, the proposed framework is applied to pressure prediction of real time-series data of three shale gas adjustable yield wells for the Fuling region in China. The experimental results show that the proposed framework provides good prediction precision over other state-of-the-art models in terms of different evaluation criteria. The main benefits of this research study are to better simulate shale gas wells in the future for engineers and academic researchers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The development of natural gas consumption forecasting tools is an important application of forecasting models. Plenty of research efforts have already been made in this area. However, the datasets used in these works could often not be published and used by other researchers. This complicates further research and the comparison of forecasting methods. In this work, we address this issue by the creation of a new dataset. We have taken into account state-of-the-art research works and included many data features that were previously proven to have a significant impact on the precision of the model. A forecasting methodology suitable for the evaluation of statistical and machine learning algorithms used in the time series forecasting domain is proposed to validate the high usability of the new dataset. The results of the application of the methodology and their discussion are included. Moreover, we made this dataset available for everyone to use for their research purposes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Based on the monthly dataset of natural gas demand and meteorological factors in heating season (November to next March) of Beijing from 2002 to 2013, an analysis of meteorological condition of natural gas fluctuation is done, which used by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and statistical correlation methods. A novel intelligent prediction model (EMD_BP) of natural gas demand in heating season via EMD and Back Propagation (BP) neural network algorithm is proposed. In addition, we adopt a prediction model only using BP neural network algorithm compare to the above combine method. The results are as follows, (1) EMD method is a better approach to decompose the social demand and meteorological demand of natural gas. (2) There is a close affinity between natural gas demand and meteorological factors in heating season. The meteorological demand of natural gas is significantly negatively correlated with the mean temperature (also minimum temperature, maximum temperature and negative accumulated temperature), but significantly positively correlated with rainfall and low temperature (≤-8℃）days. (3) Comparing with BP model, EMD_BP model can accurately fit the changing tendency of natural gas time series. The results show that the EMD_BP prediction model has better applicability and extensive popular prospect. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

AB  - The one-day-ahead forecasting of residential gas demand at country level is investigated by implementing and comparing five models: ridge regression, Gaussian process (GP), k-nearest neighbour, artificial neural network (ANN) and torus model. Italian demand data are used for testing the proposed algorithms. The most significant aspects of the pre-processing and feature engineering are discussed, lending particular attention to the role of one-day-ahead temperature forecasts. Our best model, in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), is the ANN; if the mean absolute error (MAE) is considered, the GP becomes the best model, although by a narrow margin. A novel contribution is the development of a model describing the propagation of temperature forecast errors to gas forecasting errors that is successfully validated on data. On the Italian data, it is shown that temperature errors account for 18% of the mean square error of gas demand forecasts. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Among fossil fuels, natural gas has been considered a fuel of choice for increasing the supply of energy and reducing environmental contamination worldwide. Given that the supply chain of natural gas is characterized by imbalances between demand and supply on a timely basis, effective and fast models for accurate spot price prediction for natural gas would not only inform but also help various stakeholders to make wise decisions in the competitive natural gas marketplace. Proposed in this paper is a regression ensemble learning model based on least squares boosting algorithm for improving the prediction of natural gas spot price on a monthly basis. Ensemble learning models are becoming more preferred predictive tools due to their capability to train multiple weak learning models, and aggregate their outputs to produce a strong learning model with better overall accuracy. A broad scope of time series data from January 1997 to May 2020 from Henry Hub natural gas spot prices were employed in developing and testing the proposed model. Coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are employed as performance metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Compared to four existing state-of-the-art approaches, overall results show that the proposed model exhibits better performance over the state-of-the-art methods with R2, MSE and RMSE scores of 0.9668, 0.3248, and 0.5699, respectively. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm encloses the characteristics of the advanced recurrent neural network methods and is used in this research study to forecast the natural gas demand in Greece in the short-term. LSTM is generally recognized by researchers as a key tool for time series prediction problems and has found important applicability in many different scientific domains over the last years. In this study, we apply the proposed LSTM for the purposes of a day-ahead natural gas demand prediction to three distribution points (cities) of Greece's natural gas grid. A comparative analysis was conducted by different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures and the results offer a deeper understanding of the large urban centers characteristics, showing the efficacy of the proposed methodology on predicting natural gas demand in a daily basis. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid development of big data and smart technology in the natural gas industry requires timely and accurate forecasting of natural gas consumption on different time horizons. In this work, we propose a robust hybrid hours-ahead gas consumption method by integrating Wavelet Transform, RNN-structured deep learning and Genetic Algorithm. The Wavelet Transform is used to reduce the complexity of the forecasting tasks by decomposing the original series of gas loads into several sub-components. The RNN-structured deep learning method is built up via combining a multi-layer Bi-LSTM model and a LSTM model. The multi-layer Bi-LSTM model can comprehensively capture the features in the sub-components and the LSTM model is used to forecast the future gas consumption based on these abstracted features. To enhance the performance of the RNN-structured deep learning model, Genetic Algorithm is employed to optimize the structure of each layer in the model. Besides, the dropout technology is applied in this work to overcome the potential problem of overfitting. In this case study, the effectiveness of the developed method is verified from multiple perspective, including graphical examination, mathematical errors analysis and model comparison, on different data sets. © 2019

AB  - The goal of this research study is to test the hardiness of a novel hybrid computational intelligence model in day-ahead natural gas demand prediction. The proposed model combines an evolutionary learned FCM method with a common ANN to construct a cascaded model that leads to high prediction accuracy in most distribution points. The FCM technique is used to provide a model which concepts are used as input nodes in a second-stage ANN model employed to provide the forecast for each gas time series. Learned by structure optimization genetic algorithm, the FCM outputs are fed into an ANN to refine the initial forecast and upgrade the overall forecasting accuracy. The model is applied to five distribution points that compose the natural gas grid of a Greek region, district of Thessaly. This approach enables the comparison of the hybrid model performance on different FCM and ANN structures and on consumption patterns, providing also insights on the characteristics of large urban centers and small towns. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Production and distribution activities in natural gas systems are performed by producer and distributor companies, respectively. Producer companies are responsible for attending the demands of the local distributor companies while distributor companies are responsible for leading the gas to the final consumers. The producer adjusts its production capacity, daily, considering the availability of the gas transportation pipelines network and the demands from consumers. Consequently, the distributor companies are forced to forecast, in the early hours, the total gas volume to be consumed during the whole day. If the gas consumed exceed the forecasted limits penalties are applied to the distributor companies. In this paper, three approaches for natural gas consumption forecasting are implemented and examined: The time series model Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average - (ARIMA), the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and a Hybrid Methodology combining these two techniques. Data from a northeast Brazilian distributor company has been used for validating the proposed forecasting algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - We study a special bilevel programming problem that arises in transactions between a Natural Gas Shipping Company and a Pipeline Operator. Because of the business relationships between these two actors, the timing, and objectives of their decision-making process are different. In order to model that, bilevel programming was traditionally used. Apart from the theoretical studies of the problem to facilitate its solution a linear reformulation is required, as well as heuristic approaches, and branch-and-bound techniques may be applied. We present a linear programming reformulation of the latest version of the model, which is easier and faster to solve numerically. This reformulation makes it easier to theoretically analyze the problem, allowing us to draw some conclusions about the nature of the solution. Since elements of uncertainty are definitely present in the bilevel natural gas cash-out problem, its stochastic formulation is developed in the form of a bilevel multi-stage stochastic programming model with recourse. After reducing the original formulation to a bilevel linear problem, a stochastic scenario tree is defined by its node events, and time series forecasting is used to produce stochastic values for data of natural gas price and demand. Numerical experiments were run to compare the stochastic solution with the perfect information solution and the expected value solutions. © The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach, named the SVR (support vector regression) based SVRLP (support vector regression local predictor) with FNF-SVRLP (false neighbours filtered-support vector regression local predictor), to predict short-term natural gas demand. This method integrates the SVR algorithm with the reconstruction properties of a time series, and optimises the original local predictor by removing false neighbours. A unified model, named the SM ("Standard Model"), is presented to process the entire dataset. To further improve the predicted accuracy, an AM ("Advanced Model") is proposed, and is based on specific customer behaviours during different days of the week. The AM contains seven individual models for the seven days of the week. The FNF-SVRLP based AM has been used to predict natural gas demand for the National Grid of the United Kingdom (UK). This model outperforms the SVRLP, the ARMA (autoregressive moving average) and the ANN (artificial neural network) methods when applied to real-world data obtained from National Grid and has been successfully applied to daily gas operations for National Grid. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is widely accepted that natural gas is a clean energy source that can be used to meet energy demand for heating and industrial purpose among the fossil fuels and its usage remarkably increases in order to maintain a clean environment in many countries in the world. It is fact that this makes energy investment planning in a country or region highly important for suitable economic development as well as environmental aspect. Therefore, energy demand for various sectors should be estimated in the frame of short-term energy policy. For accurate estimation of short-term energy demand a limited number of computational methods are employed by using the 4 yearly measured natural gas consumption values. Among these methods, the ANN and time series are widely used for short-term estimation of natural gas consumption in Turkey's certain regions. In this study, multilayer perceptron the ANNs with time series approach is proposed to forecast short-term natural gas consumption. Meteorological data (moisture, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and ambient temperature) obtained from the regional gas distribution company and the local meteorology office in last 4 years to construct well-tuned algorithm. Although the number of data was small, the proposed algorithm works well to forecast the short-term natural gas consumption and produces encouraging and meaningful outcomes for future energy investment policy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Automatic process control requires the maximum amount of information about the future beha-vior of parameters that affect the regulated system. For a particular set of processes, formal mathematical relationships describing this behavior can be established. However, certain processes cannot be described by formal relationships and their analyses must be based on statistical evaluation of their past histories. In the particular case of multivariate processes, regres sion and time series analyses are the two most powerful tools which can be utilized to describe their behavior and to project this behavior into the future. The above techniques were studied using data from a small natural gas distribution system. The natural gas demand for space heating and the prevailing meteorological conditions were recorded hourly for a group of lk residential homes in Northern California for over a year's time. Statistical evaluation of the data included study of the correlations of precipitation, wind velocity and direction, radiation, relative humidity, and temperature with demand. Temperature and relative humidity showed the best correlation with demand. Stepwise regressional analysis applied to the parameters and various combinations of them revealed that mean values or gradients, predominantly of temperature conditions, are needed in order to stabilize the system and to obtain reasonable predictions. However, due to the averaging propensity of regressional analyses, peak demands are not well predicted. This difficulty is minimized if one uses methods of time series analysis. Various methods for detrending and elimination of periodicities were checked in order to obtain stationary series to which autoregressive spectral analysis can be applied. Linear filters seem to be simple and yet are as powerful as more complicated ones. Of the three algorithms (matrix defactorization and the autoregressive schemes of Hingorani and of Robinson) tested for spectral analytic predictions, Robinson's proved to be the most efficient. This algorithm also has the advantage that, in additior to better accuracy than the regressional analysis, only a relatively short record length is necessary Therefore, for example, no corrections for population growth in the demand are needed. In the present application it was concluded that the greater accuracy of the Robinson algorithm far outweighs the additional costs incurred by the lengthier computations and greate: complexity of the method over regression analysis Better and more complete data and improved weathei forecasting techniques will be required for direct application of the method to automatic control. © Copyright 1969 American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc.
